- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Buckyball64
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software for the ESP32 Color Kit Grande
- I have built the kit, but when it comes to the software, I have folloed the instructions to install Visual studios, and opened the settings.h file, but I get a number of errors "string is unidentified"
- and "Unit16_t is undefined.
- how does one fix this, and what are the next steps?
- Thanks,
- Dave
